      Our application screens each incoming call (text) and determines if they are safe for you to engage with. Then the virtual assistant will direct the call to the phone, to voice mail or will block the number and hang up. Our users can opt in for immediate notifications of blocked calls with the audio recording and text transcript of the conversation between the virtual assistant and the caller available for review. The notifications and the end of day blocked call report provide the user an opportunity to review the decisions made by the virtual assistant. This enables the virtual assistant to continuously learn from the individual user’s feedback and thus increases its accuracy and providing a more customized personal experience. The result for the user is a silent phone and superior security for you and your loved ones, where no call is allowed through unless you want it.

          Digerini™ can offer parents more peace of mind when deciding whether their children should have cell phones. They need the ability to monitor at least some of their teen’s electronic activity. Young people are vulnerable to online predators and cyber-bullying, both of which are growing at an alarming rate, and the ease of blocking a number and the ability to review the end-of-day call report helps parents understand who is trying to contact their children. Another benefit of having Digerini™ silence unwanted calls and text messages is that it can ensure that the phone itself won’t be a distraction while driving. Digerini™ offers a way for parents to add an extra layer of safety to their children’s digital experience.

          Digerini™ can also help protect the independence of seniors while boosting their protection from mobile phone scams. These kinds of phone scams are the most commonly used scams against the elderly and can wipe out a person’s entire life savings in a matter of minutes. While other call screening services simply forward the scammers to voicemail, where they can still threaten or confuse the person on the other end of the line, Digerini™ can prevent that call or message from ever being heard by an unsuspecting senior. Digerini’s intuitive design ensures that seniors can set up this protection and include other family members or caregivers to help monitor their privacy.

          Busy professionals and executives find it very hard to be productive when they are constantly interrupted by their phones. Even a two-second interruption in order to see who is calling can disrupt concentration, slow down productivity, and increase errors while performing a task. They are often forced to silence everything, which results in missed connections with clients DigeriniTM solves this problem by allowing work calls to continue through while hanging up and blocking the potential scam or unwanted calls. This allows reports to be finished or emails to be responded to without the frustration of being interrupted. DigeriniTM gives control back to those that need it in their daily schedules.

          Like executives, the productive time of students needs to be protected. When unwanted calls interrupt homework or assignments, the pull of social media and other apps can turn into an even longer-lasting distraction. Simply going into “do not disturb” isn’t always an option either as cell phones often double as an extra research device. During class, students are able to focus more without their phones vibrating unnecessarily in their pockets. When concentration is ruined while learning new concepts, it severely diminishes the ability to retain the new information being taught. DigeriniTM is the perfect student companion to ensure that they are able to be successful in class.
