If you receive a phone call from an unknown number, there is certain information in which you should keep your lips airtight. This is information that people can use to steal your entire identity and can drain your bank account. You do not want to be the victim of a scammer and have your life’s earnings and hard work reduced to ashes. 

These are the types of **sensitive information** the scammer wants and you must protect: 


### Full Name

Unless that individual says your name first, you should avoid saying your full name to someone. That person could record you saying your full name and then use that as a way to get consent into stealing more of your personal information.

### SSI or Financial Information

Most of the time, government officials are not going to reach out to you via phone to confirm any personal or private information, so social security numbers and financial records should not be something you discuss with someone you do not know.

### Passwords 

If you are not going to say this to someone in public or even to a friend, definitely do not disclose this information to someone you do not know over a phone call. Passwords to your accounts should be avoided and should not be discussed at all. 

### Personal Information 

If that person on the other end is asking for very personal information, such as your mother’s maiden name or the name of your first pet, you should not give them the answer at all. First off, those are some of the most asked security questions to verify your identity, so do not give out the information, as that person can easily impersonate you and steal your information through those means.
